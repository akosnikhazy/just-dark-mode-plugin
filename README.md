# Just dark mode WordPress plugin
A dark mode switch for WordPress

I needed dark mode plugin, but all I found was a lot of bloatware that was too heavy to use, also phoned home, also made database tables with users ip addresses, that is not good if you want to be complient with GDPR and such.

Warning: This version is not the one that might or might not be on the official plugin directory. Use it if you want, but read the license.

# How to install?
Just copy the post-grid-wordpress-plugin folder in wp-content/plugins/ folder. Or zip the folder and upload it on plugin admin page on WordPress.

# Use cases
As it uses simple CSS ```filter:invert(1)``` trick, it might give you bad results with colorful sites. Best for greyscale sites. Also it does not invert images, videos and iframes.
